## How to use
In order to use this webb project, you must move your mouse. The website tracks the position of your mouse, and based on which grid section of the page your mouse is on, it sets the parameters to gerenrate the rose curve. You must hold your mouse in that position, otherwise the rose will not fully generate.

## The math
The way this is powered is using a parametric equation. The parametric equaitons x = cos(k\theta)cos(\theta).
